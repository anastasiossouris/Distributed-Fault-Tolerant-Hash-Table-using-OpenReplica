hash-table-report: A short report for my project (in pdf and word 2007 formats)
openreplica-hashtable: A (very bad!) presentation (in pdf and power-point 2007 formats)
src: The code i wrote for my project. The files bucket.py, bucket_manager.py, sorted_key_value_list.py and hash_table.py contain 
the implementation of the hash-table. The rest of the files are for tests and for demonstration and should not be
read by others because i wrote them so that only i can understand them (that is they are written in the worst-manner possible!)
